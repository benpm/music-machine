# Music Machine
A simple bot which automatically produces music blog posts. When a song is added to a specific Spotify playlist, a search is made on Last FM for tags, Genius for a song description, and YouTube for a corresponding video. Then, the Tumblr API is used to create an audio post on a Tumblr account with all of the song metadata.
